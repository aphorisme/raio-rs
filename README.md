# Overview


# Technical Overview

There is `Connection` which provides the low level runtime building 
block, but does not implement any client logic. It provides the async
functionality to connect to a bolt server, send requests and read
responses. Among these low level functionalities, there is `Manager`
and `Pool` as well. This level is based upon `deadpool` to provide
a pool of connections for async handling.

The high level entry point is `Client`. This does use a connection
pool and the low level `Connection` to implement all client logic,
e.g. transactions, queries, etc.
